## Overview

The user management system handles user accounts, authentication, and authorization. It supports different user roles and maintains user profiles with various attributes.

## User Roles

The system supports two main roles:
- **User**: Regular users with standard permissions
- **Admin**: Administrative users with additional privileges

### Role Permissions

#### Regular Users Can:
- Manage their own profile
- Update their availability
- View their notifications

#### Admins Can:
- All regular user permissions
- Send notifications to users
- View all notifications in the system
- Manage user accounts

## User Profile

Each user profile contains:

### Required Information
- **Name**: Full name of the user
- **Email**: Unique email address (used for login)
- **Password**: Securely hashed password

### Optional Information
- **Mobile Number**: Contact phone number
- **Bio**: Brief user description
- **Availability**: Weekly schedule
- **Role**: User role (defaults to "user")

## Authentication

Users authenticate using:
- Email and password combination
- JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Security**
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
   - Minimum password requirements enforced

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - JWT validation for protected endpoints

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Sensitive data is never exposed in responses
   - Passwords are never returned in API responses
