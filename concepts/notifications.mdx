## Overview

The notification system enables administrators to send messages to users. It supports both immediate and scheduled notifications, with different priority levels and delivery statuses.

## Notification Types

### Based on Priority
- **Regular Notifications**: Standard system messages
- **Critical Notifications**: High-priority messages that require immediate attention

### Based on Timing
- **Immediate**: Sent right away
- **Scheduled**: Set for future delivery

## Notification States

Notifications can be in one of three states:
- **Pending**: Created but not yet processed
- **Queued**: Scheduled for future delivery
- **Delivered**: Successfully sent to recipients

## Notification Structure

Each notification contains:
- **Sender**: Admin who sent the notification
- **Recipients**: List of users to receive the notification
- **Message**: The notification content
- **Critical Flag**: Indicates high priority
- **Timestamp**: When the notification was created
- **Status**: Current state of the notification
- **Delivery Time**: When the notification was delivered
- **Schedule Time**: When the notification is planned to be sent

## Admin Features

Administrators can:
1. **Send Notifications**
   - To individual users
   - To multiple users at once
   - With or without critical priority
   - With immediate or scheduled delivery

2. **Track Notifications**
   - View all sent notifications
   - Monitor delivery status
   - See delivery timestamps

## Best Practices

1. **Message Content**
   - Keep messages clear and concise
   - Include relevant action items
   - Specify importance through the critical flag

2. **Scheduling**
   - Use ISO 8601 datetime format
   - Consider recipient time zones
   - Allow sufficient lead time for scheduled notifications

3. **Recipients**
   - Verify recipient IDs before sending
   - Group related recipients together
   - Consider notification relevance to recipients
