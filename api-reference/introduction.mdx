## Welcome

This documentation provides information about the User Management System API endpoints. The API is organized around REST principles and uses JWT tokens for authentication.

### Base URL

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

### Authentication

Most API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens (JWT). Include the token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
